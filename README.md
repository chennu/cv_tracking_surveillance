Technology seems to be a miracle when we control everything without any human effort. A countryâ€™s development also lies on the usage of its engineering applications in various fields. One such field is Computer vision. Of all the senses we have, vision is the most powerful sense. Similar to human vision, Computer vision tries to interpret the objects around using cameras attached to a computer. 

Detection of people and Video Surveillance are widely used applications of computer vision. It employs Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) networks, through which the security and surveillance methods can be implemented. The video frames are processed and sent to a central location system where close observation is done and displayed on several video monitors and recorded.

In this project, initially the algorithms based on such applications were implemented on an image. Later by using several other methods it is extended on a video for detecting and tracking the person entered in highly prohibited and secured areas. Hence, at these locations which demand high security, the CCTV camera system can be  modified into an automatic intruder alarm system.

In this project, we have two parts:
1) People Tracking 
2) Face Detection.

Here for the people tracking, we used 1) Frame Difference Method 2) Approximate Median method .

And can find the differences easily by seeing the output.


For Face Detection we have used inbuilt Face detector (Viola Jones Algorithm). The algorithm is used on both image and a video.
After detection of the face, a simple auto cropping of the face is being implemented to store the faces in a database.
